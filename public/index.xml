    <a href="#why-do-i-want-to-start-writing" class="header-mark"></a>Why do I want to start writing?</h1><p>I actually want to write for a long time now, but after reading one of PG article in which he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn&rsquo;t written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial.
It feels to them as if they do, especially if they&rsquo;re not in the habit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel complete. It&rsquo;s only when you try to put them into words that you discover they&rsquo;re not. So if you never subject your ideas to that test, you&rsquo;ll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never realize it.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>
