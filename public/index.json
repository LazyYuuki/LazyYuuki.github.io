[{"categories":null,"content":" About meI am just a random software engineer on the internet who really like to build cool things and be at the edge playing with all the most interesting technology we have to offer. Currently, I am deeply interested in the field of Deep Learning on edge devices and scaling Deep Learning services for production in a reliable and cost efficient manner. The name of this blog come from the fact that I am very lazy about a lot of things, and that laziness has helped me find shorter path to do a lot more things. With that spirit in mind, I want this blog to be an interesting place to showcase my lazy finding and hopefully help someone too.
