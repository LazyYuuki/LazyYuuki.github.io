**Show your work: 10 ways to share your creativity and get discovered - Austin Kleon**

> If you want people to know about what you do and the thing you care about, you have to share.

> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You already naked.

> By putting things out there, consistently, you can form a relationship with your customers. It allows them to see the person behind the products.

> Become a documentarian of what you do.

> The reading feeds the writing, which feeds the reading

> Your influences are all worth sharing because they clue people in to who you are and what you do - sometimes even more than your own work.

> "Dumpster diving" is one of the jobs of the artist - finding the treasure in other people's trash, sifting through the debris of our culture, paying attention to the stuff that everyone else is ignoring, and taking inspiration from the stuff that people have tossed aside for whatever reasons.

> All it takes to uncover hidden gems is a clear eye, an open mind, and a willingness to search for inspiration in places other people aren't willing or able to go.

> Art forgery is a strange phenomenon. "You might think that the pleasure you get from a painting depends on its color and its shape and its pattern," says psychology professor Paul Bloom. "And if that's right, it shoudln't matter whether it's an original or a forgery." But our brains don't work that way. "When shown an object, or given a food, or shown a face, people's assessment of it - how much they like it, how valuable it is - is deeply affected by what you tell them about it."

> Stories are such a powerful drive of emotional value that thier effect on any given object's subjective value can actually be measured objectively.

> "The cat sat on a mat" is not a story. "The cat sat on the dog's mat" is a story. - Joh le Carre

> I call these people human spam ... They don't want to pay their dues, they want their piece right here, right now. They don't want to listen to your ideas; they want to tell you theirs ... At dome point, they didn't get the memo that the world owes none of us anything.
