## Bitmask:
A technique of using binary logical operation to figure out if an element has been visited or existed before in an array instead of using set. For small problem, it is usually much faster and much more space efficient.

## Prefix and suffix array:
Traversing one array up and down to be able to calculate the value at an index `i` without involving the value at the index `i` itself.

## Short-circuit evaluation: 
When using the logical AND operator, we can be sure that if the first condition is not true, the second condition wonâ€™t be evaluated. This will help allow us to run code that would otherwise error without satisfying the first condition in the second condition portion.
