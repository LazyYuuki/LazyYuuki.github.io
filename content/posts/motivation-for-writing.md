# Why do I want to start writing?

I actually want to write for a long time now, but after reading one of PG article in which he said:

"If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial.
It feels to them as if they do, especially if they're not in the habit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel complete. It's only when you try to put them into words that you discover they're not. So if you never subject your ideas to that test, you'll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never realize it."

I just have to start writing because I am afraid I will become a person that cannot put my thought into words, and hence, does not have any thought of my owns.

Now, I think that with time, my thought my change, what I written here might not be what I believe in anymore. But the effort to put it down into words, will let me learn from my past and keep growing to become an independent thinker.

- You know that putting your ideas into words changed them.
- Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test.
- You can know a great deal about something without writing about it. Can you ever know so much that you wouldn't learn more from trying to explain what you know? I don't think so.
- In both cases there were things I didn't consciously realize till I had to explain them. And I don't think my experience was anomalous. A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners.
