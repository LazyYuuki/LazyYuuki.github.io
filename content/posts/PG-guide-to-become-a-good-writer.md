As I start writing more and more, writing becomes easier to produce but harder to perfect. You would think that as you write more, your ideas would tend to dry up and so you produce less but with higher quality. But I have found that experience to be the opposite for me. Ideas don't tend to dry up, and the more you write the more you see the flaws in your writing.

> Write simply. The less friction and energy draining the writing is, the more likely people will get to the end. Write first draft fast, then spend times cutting it down to make it even simpler.

I have to admit I am much better at talking than I am writing. And that is probably because talking require much less intention than writing:

> As you decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter - PG. The statement is just too good to not be quoted [link](https://paulgraham.com/speak.html)

This would probably ruffle a lot of feathers, but what PG said is true. If you think about it retrospectively, how many percentage can you remember after attending a talk and conference? I would wager probably less than 20%. That is because talking is much faster and more dynamic than writing. And there is a limit to our brain processing capacity. We have been trained to pick up important and relevant info, instead of trying to memorise everything. However, that would also means that you will never remembered the full context surrent a point that is made in a talk. And so, you re-interpret it, fill in the gaps so that you can internalise such messages. What you have not realised is that, that process is the same as writing, just happening in your brain instead. Without this retro-inspection process, that idea will never be able to internalise by you. And for most people, that is indeed the case, they only remember the main point, but never done the retro-inspection. That means effectively, the audience have their intelligence reduce just by the nature of listening, and as the speaker get better as bullshitting important term to job our brain attention, they become a better speaker just by the nature of how our brain works. And I want to avoid become a bullshitter.

Writing a good essay is really really hard. It is especially more so for a person who barely done any personal writing before. The problem lies in consistency. When you write a lot, it tends to be that most of them are of low quality. However, if you keep trying to perfect your essay, you will never published anything either, and the whole things feel like a waste of time. It is a delicate balance between passion and persistence. I can only build up the good habbit, if I feel like I accomplish something out of it at the end of the day. Hence, while I know, it bounds to happen that some of my essays can be of lower quality, it is imperative for me to still push them out, going against PG teaching of only publish high quality work. Now, don't get me wrong, I put in the same amount of effort even for the "lower quality" essays. It is just that sometimes I could not find the pulse of an essays, but throwing it all away wholesale brings too much pain for me. So I would rather exposes my flaws and getting judged for it, then feel like I have achieved nothing. Because writing is time intensive, so I try to make the most out of it. 

> Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write them. [link](https://paulgraham.com/words.html)
