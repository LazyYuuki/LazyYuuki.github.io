# PG wisdom to become a good writer

- Write the way you talk. If you don't talk that way to your friends, then don't write it that way either. [link](https://paulgraham.com/talk.html)
- Write simply. The less friction and energy draining the writing is, the more likely people will get to the end. Write first draft fast, then spend times cutting it down to make it even simpler.

- As you decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter - PG. The statement is just too good to not be quoted [link](https://paulgraham.com/speak.html)
- Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write them. [link](https://paulgraham.com/words.html)


- Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible. [link](https://paulgraham.com/useful.html)
