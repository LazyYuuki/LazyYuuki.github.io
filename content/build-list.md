# A list of thing that I want to build

This is where I brain-dump all of my "greatest idea ever that may or may not see the light of day that I want to build."

1. [ ] Another Tensor Library
2. [ ] Make a note editor as a PWA that can run on Ipad
3. [ ] Contribute new exercise to Exercism in the Zig track
4. [ ] Make a algorithm visualization platform that translates code into visual for ease of learning
5. [ ] An alternative to Bacon in Rust but for Zig
6. [ ] A TUI for managing Docker in the Terminal (because screw the bloated GUI)
7. [ ] A flappy bird game in the Terminal
8. [ ] An app to monitor computer usage right from the Terminal
9. [ ] An app that you can just upload a csv on and ask it to process the data and generate a chart for you
